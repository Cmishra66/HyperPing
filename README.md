## How It Works

### 1. Prospect Input Form

Users fill out a simple form with:

- Prospect’s Name  
- Company Name  
- Estimated Employee Size  
- Company Website  

### 2. Company Enrichment via SerpAPI

Upon submission, HyperPing uses **SerpAPI** to scrape and enrich company information:

- Company industry  
- Recent news  
- Key decision-makers *(planned)*  
- Additional personalization context  

### 3. Message Generation via DeepSeek

The enriched data is passed to **DeepSeek API**, which intelligently generates:

- A personalized email draft  
- A contextual LinkedIn message  

These drafts are tailored using real-time company and role-specific context, eliminating generic outreach.

### 4. Direct Email Delivery via Resend API

Using the **Resend API**, the user can instantly send emails directly from the dashboard:

- Fast, reliable transactional email delivery  
- Clean and modern JavaScript-friendly API
